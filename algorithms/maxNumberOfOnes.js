// Description: Two brothers were playing a game. Their mother gave them an array
// of numbers, with each element being either 0 or 1. She then asked them to find
//  out the maximum number of 1s they could obtain by inversion of the bits,
//  i.e., changing all the 0s to 1s and all the 1s to 0 for any contiguous portion of the array.

// The younger brother thought he could solve the problem in his head, but the
// elder brother chose to write a program to find the optimal solution. Can you help the elder brother?

// Input:

// The first line of input contains an integer N, representing the size of the array.
// The second line of input contains N space-separated integers, representing the array elements.
// Output:

// The output is the maximum number of 1s you can make in one inversion.
// Constraints:

// 1 ‚â§ ùëÅ ‚â§ 100
// 1‚â§N‚â§100
